	  <p class > I genuinely enjoyed this essay much more than I initially thought I would. Having the author be someone old enough to remember the beginning of the internet and the World Wide Web is perfect because they recall the excitement, innocence, and charm of the early days. This was a time before hundreds of thousands of people flooded the internet, changing its landscape forever.</p>
	  
	  <p>The initial plan for the web was for it to be used primarily by conglomerate corporations and the upper class of society. Sure, the internet wasnt very pretty, organized, or easy to navigate, but like anything new in life, it takes time to develop. All babies are ugly when they are first born (in my opinion). They dont know how to navigate anything or organize anything for the life of them. The web was a baby people had to dig deep to find the gold, the exciting sites and resources they sought out for themselves.</p>
	  
	  <p>As more people discovered the web and began exploring and creating, the original founders werent too fond of that because it wasnt part of their initial plan. Eventually, the web was almost taken away from the people because their participation and creations were deemed personal artifacts something that wasnt considered professional or historically notable, and therefore, supposedly worthless.</p>
	  
	  <p>I never truly thought about how GIFs, nostalgia, user interfaces, and advertisements keep us hooked on social media. The one thing we were never supposed to have or even know about is now something that everyone possesses. Ironically, the internet, which was once exclusive, has become one of the driving forces of the world today.</p>
	  
	  <p>The internet was like a baby when first created, but like any baby, without proper care, guidance, and appreciation, how are people supposed to truly understand its purpose and take full advantage of it to bring the world together? While the internet does connect different parts of the world, it also divides us. You must take the good with the bad there is no picking and choosing.</p>
	  
	  <p>Sure, as an individual, you somewhat control what you see on your browser feed, Instagram, Facebook, X, etc., but think back to how the author described the early internet. I see it as a blank search engine with nothing but a search bar. You typed in keywords, hoping to get the results you were looking for. It was never as easy as it is now. Today, you dont even have to type in words remotely accurate to your search to find what youre looking for.</p>
	  
	  <p>Nowadays, the internet is primarily used for entertainment, advertising the latest trends, and keeping up with celebrities. Many people browse just for the sake of it, without any genuine purpose. Yes, people still do research, learn, and share knowledge online, but after a full day of school or work, how many people come home eager to stare at an OLED screen with max brightness and 10pt font?</p>
	  
	  <p>The internet was meant to help us it did and still does but I believe it is now hurting us more than helping. We are free to roam the web, anonymously, for as long as we want, pretending to be whoever we want. The genuine excitement, curiosity, and joy of the internet seem to be gone. Now, it simply continues doing what it has been doing, and I feel as if everything has reached its peak growth. What goes up must come down, and perhaps, the internet has begun its decay.</p>
