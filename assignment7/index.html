			Deep within the shadows of global intelligence, there exists a clandestine organization known only as British Battalion Catchers, whose sole mission is to uncover the truth behind the British Empire. For decades, the group has operated in the highest levels of secrecy, gathering intelligence on the United Kingdom, driven by a growing suspicion that the nation and its storied history may not be what they seem. Whispers abound that Britain has fabricated its grandeur, and that its leaders are mere actors in a sprawling, worldwide performance. Using a vast network of agents and cutting-edge technology, The Verdant Order monitors everything from historical archives to modern political strategies, searching for cracks in the fa√ßade that would reveal whether the British Empire was ever real, or simply an elaborate myth orchestrated for centuries to maintain a global narrative.

			BBC: Confirmed news; the British are not real; Britian is not real. Spread the news, any Britian's spotted are to be considered armed and dangerous as a form of deceit so deep, for so long, to everyone, is inexcusable.
